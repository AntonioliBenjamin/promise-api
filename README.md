Hey you,

You're learning how to write a promise. For this exercice, i want you to write the same function but with a different way of doing it.<br/>

We have two api, one for user information and another one for foods, i would like you to have a random name (title firstname lastname) and a food list that you retrieve from the API.

I written for you two function where you can write the code then launch it. If you successfully log the result once the code has been launch, you will be successful !

<br/>

Good luck and may the force be with you !..
